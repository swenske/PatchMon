# Pinned to $BUILDPLATFORM. The output is static JS/CSS/HTML (see the COPY of
# /app/frontend/dist below), which is architecture-independent, so there is
# nothing to gain from building it once per target platform — and a great deal
# to lose. Without this pin BuildKit instantiates this stage for every
# --platform in the build, so the linux/arm64 variant runs Node and npm under
# QEMU user-mode emulation on an amd64 runner. That crashed `npm ci` with
# "qemu: uncaught target signal 4 (Illegal instruction)" and exit code 132,
# while the native amd64 variant of the same step succeeded in seconds.
#
# Pinning also roughly halves this stage's wall-clock cost, since the install
# and the Vite build no longer run twice. The consumer of dist is the `builder`
# stage, which is itself $BUILDPLATFORM-pinned, so nothing downstream needs a
# target-architecture copy of these files.
