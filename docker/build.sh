# Build the PatchMon server Docker image locally.
#
# The git tag is the single source of truth for the version. Nothing in the
# repo declares one, so the version has to be passed into the image build.
# This script works it out for you and passes it through as a build arg.
#
# .dockerignore excludes .git, so the Dockerfile cannot derive the version
# itself. That is why this wrapper exists rather than a plain `docker build`.
#
# Usage:
#   ./docker/build.sh                      # version from the nearest git tag
#   ./docker/build.sh --version 2.0.1      # pin a version (useful for testing
#                                          # the auto-update path)
#   ./docker/build.sh --tag mytag          # image tag (default: local)
#   ./docker/build.sh --skip-agents        # reuse whatever is in agents-prebuilt/
#
# Equivalent by hand:
#   docker build -f docker/server.Dockerfile \
#     --build-arg VERSION="$(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 | sed 's/^v//')" \
#     -t patchmon-server:local .
