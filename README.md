## What is PatchMon?

PatchMon is an enterprise-grade platform that gives operations teams a single pane of glass to monitor, patch and secure their Linux fleet, with FreeBSD and Windows agent support.

A lightweight agent communicates outbound-only to the PatchMon server on your schedule - no inbound ports required on monitored hosts - delivering real-time visibility into package health, compliance posture and system status across environments of any scale.

---

## Why PatchMon?

- **Outbound-only agents** - no inbound firewall changes, no SSH or WinRM exposure, no VPN required.
- **Single binary, bundled UI** - one Go binary with the React frontend embedded. One container, no Node runtime at deploy time.
- **Open source, with a managed cloud** - AGPL v3 licensed, free to self-host. Production hosting available at [patchmon.net/cloud](https://patchmon.net/cloud).
- **Multi-OS by design** - Linux (apt, dnf, yum, apk, pacman), FreeBSD (pkg) and Windows, handled by the same agent and control plane.

---

## Quick Start

Docker is the fastest way to try PatchMon:

```bash
mkdir patchmon && cd patchmon
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PatchMon/PatchMon/refs/heads/main/docker/setup-env.sh)"
docker compose up -d
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`, create an admin user, add a host in the UI and copy the generated install command onto the target server.

Full deployment options (Docker manual, Proxmox LXC, PatchMon Cloud) are in the [Deployment](#deployment-options) section.

## Features at a Glance

### Patch Management

The core of PatchMon - orchestrate updates across your fleet with validation, approval and live visibility.

| Capability | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **Dry-Run Validation** | Preview the exact package transaction on a host before anything touches production. Every run captures the full plan so you know what would change. |
| **Approve & Execute** | One-click approval turns a validated dry-run into a real patch run, with a per-host audit trail of who approved what and when. |
| **Scheduled Patching** | Patch policies decide when updates apply - immediate, maintenance window or delayed rollout. Approve now, execute later. |
| **Live Patch Streaming** | Watch patch execution in real time from the browser. Agent stdout/stderr is streamed over WebSocket, with the ability to stop a run mid-flight. |
| **Selective Patching** | Target specific packages, security-only updates or a full upgrade. Works across apt, dnf, yum, apk, pacman and FreeBSD pkg. |
| **Patch History & Audit** | Full searchable history of every run - exit code, duration, packages touched, approver and host. |

### Visibility & Inventory

| Capability | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **Personalised Dashboard** | Per-user, drag-and-reorder overview cards showing fleet health, outdated packages, host status and patching activity at a glance. |
| **Host Inventory** | Browse every enrolled server with OS, uptime, kernel, last check-in and group membership. |
| **Package Inventory** | View every installed package across your fleet, filter to outdated or vulnerable ones, and see exactly which hosts need attention. |
| **Repository Tracking** | Every APT / YUM / DNF / APK / pacman repository configured on each host, in one place. |
| **Docker Monitoring** | Automatic discovery of containers, images, volumes and networks with real-time status pushed over WebSocket. |

### Security & Compliance

| Capability | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **Compliance Scanning** | Run OpenSCAP CIS Benchmarks and Docker Bench for Security. Track compliance scores over time with rule-level results and remediation guidance. |
| **Alerting** | Host-down, pending server updates and agent-update alerts. Filter by severity, type and status; assign to team members. |
| **Outbound-Only Agent** | No inbound ports on monitored hosts. Agent initiates all traffic, with IP allow-lists for enrolment tokens and rate limiting on every endpoint. |
| **RBAC** | Multi-user accounts with fully customisable roles and granular permissions - every team member sees only what they need. |
| **OIDC Single Sign-On** | Authenticate with Authentik, Keycloak, Okta or any OIDC provider. Supports auto user provisioning, group-to-role mapping and SSO-only enforcement. |

### Access & Operations

| Capability | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **Web SSH Terminal** | Browser-based SSH to any host directly from the UI. Direct or proxy mode (route through the agent, no SSH port exposure). |
| **AI Terminal Assistant** | Built-in AI chat panel inside the SSH terminal for command suggestions, error diagnosis and context-aware help. Works with OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI or Google Gemini. |
| **Branding & Theming** | Upload custom logos and favicon, choose colour themes and toggle light / dark mode per user. |

### Platform

| Capability | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **Integrations** | 33+ integrations including Proxmox LXC auto-enrolment, getHomepage, Ansible and more. |
| **REST API** | Full `/api/v1` with JWT authentication and interactive Swagger / OpenAPI docs at `/api-docs`. |

## Deployment Options

### PatchMon Cloud

> **14-day trial** at **[patchmon.net/pricing](https://patchmon.net/pricing)**

Fully managed PatchMon hosting with zero infrastructure overhead. We handle provisioning, updates, backups and scaling so you can focus on your fleet instead of the tooling behind it.

### Self-Hosted - Docker (Officially supported)

Docker is the preferred and supported self-hosted deployment. We use hardened images for security.

**Automated setup** from an empty directory. The setup script downloads `docker-compose.yml` and `env.example`, generates all required secrets, and walks you through URL and `CORS_ORIGIN` configuration interactively:

```bash
mkdir patchmon && cd patchmon
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PatchMon/PatchMon/refs/heads/main/docker/setup-env.sh)"
docker compose up -d
```

Access the application at the URL you configured (default: `http://localhost:3000`).

**Manual Docker setup:** see [Installing PatchMon Server on Docker](https://patchmon.net/docs/patchmon-operator-guide#installing-patchmon-server-on-docker).

### Self-Hosted - Proxmox LXC

One-command LXC deployment via the [Proxmox VE Helper-Scripts](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=patchmon) community script:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/main/ct/patchmon.sh)"
```

### Enrolling Hosts

Once the server is running:

1. Log in to the UI and add a host under **Hosts**.
2. PatchMon generates a one-line install command with a per-host API key.
3. Paste the command on the target server (requires root/sudo) and the agent enrols itself.

Supported agent platforms: Linux (amd64, 386, arm64, arm), FreeBSD (amd64, 386, arm64, arm), Windows (amd64, 386, arm64).

### Minimum Server Specs

| Resource | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| CPU | 2 vCPU |
| RAM | 2 GB |
| Disk | 15 GB |

---

## Architecture

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| Backend | Go, sqlc, chi router |
| Frontend | React + Vite, embedded in the `patchmon-server` binary |
| Database | PostgreSQL 17 |
| Queue | Redis 7 (Asynq) |
| Agent | Go binary - Linux, FreeBSD, Windows |

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Browser / Admin UI] -- HTTPS --> B[Your Reverse Proxy]
    B -- HTTP --> C[Backend - Go Binary]
    C -- TCP --> D[(PostgreSQL)]
    C -- TCP --> R[(Asynq + Redis)]
    E[Agents on your servers] -- HTTPS + WSS --> C
```

Agents initiate all communication. HTTPS carries reports and config; WSS (WebSocket over TLS) carries real-time events such as live patch streaming and Docker status.
Ensure that **Websockets** is supported by your proxy when passing the traffic to PatchMon container :3000 or whichever port you decide to use.
