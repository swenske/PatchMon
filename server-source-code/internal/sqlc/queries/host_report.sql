-- name: BulkUpsertPackages :many
-- Bulk upsert N packages in a single statement, eliminating per-row round-trips.
--
-- Caller MUST pre-sort the input rows by name AND deduplicate by name
-- (deterministic lock acquisition; ON CONFLICT cannot affect the same row
-- twice in one statement — cardinality_violation 21000). The inner ORDER BY
-- name in the `input` CTE is belt-and-braces: PostgreSQL's executor processes
-- INSERT...SELECT tuples in plan order, and the explicit Sort node above
-- jsonb_to_recordset guarantees that order even if the planner introduces
-- parallel workers (unlikely at this row count). Both layers must remain —
-- do not strip the ORDER BY thinking the Go-side sort is sufficient. Sorted
-- lock acquisition prevents the cross-host 40P01 deadlocks reported in
-- production.
--
-- Input shape: a single jsonb array of objects, each with keys
--   { id, name, description, category, latest_version }
-- We use jsonb_to_recordset rather than parallel text[]+unnest because sqlc
-- v1.x's static analyzer cannot resolve the multi-array unnest() overload
-- ("function unnest(unknown, ...) does not exist"). jsonb_to_recordset gives
-- the same per-row shape with one well-typed parameter and zero overload
-- ambiguity.
--
-- Description / category / latest_version are JSON nulls when the agent
-- omits them, which jsonb_to_recordset emits as SQL NULL directly.
--
-- The DO UPDATE WHERE clause skips no-op updates: when the agent reports the
-- same description/category/latest_version that's already stored, no row
-- update happens and no dead tuple is created. Steady-state production
-- workloads with mostly-stable package catalogues see ~95% of upsert calls
-- become no-ops, drastically reducing WAL volume and vacuum pressure.
--
-- It does NOT avoid the row lock: the ON CONFLICT arbiter takes its
-- FOR NO KEY UPDATE lock on the conflicting tuple BEFORE evaluating this
-- WHERE, and holds it to end of transaction whether or not the update
-- fires. Deadlock freedom comes from the sorted lock acquisition above, not
-- from this clause.
--
-- The UNION ALL fallback returns (id, name) for input rows that did NOT fire
-- DO UPDATE (i.e. the values are unchanged), covering the single-threaded
-- case where every input name resolves to an id.
--
-- It is NOT complete under concurrency. The ON CONFLICT arbiter re-reads the
-- conflicting row outside the statement snapshot, so it can see a row another
-- transaction committed after this statement began; if that row's values are
-- identical the skip-no-op WHERE suppresses RETURNING, while the fallback
-- SELECT still reads `packages` at the (older) statement snapshot and cannot
-- see the row either. That name is then absent from the result. The caller
-- MUST detect missing names and resolve them with GetPackageIDsByNames, which
-- runs as a separate statement and therefore takes a fresh snapshot.
--
-- The DO UPDATE intentionally touches only NON-KEY columns
-- (description / category / latest_version / updated_at). The row lock taken
-- by ON CONFLICT is therefore FOR NO KEY UPDATE, which does NOT conflict
-- with FOR KEY SHARE locks held by concurrent BulkInsertHostPackages FK
-- checks on the same packages.id rows. Do not extend this DO UPDATE to
-- touch id or name without re-evaluating the lock-compatibility analysis.

-- row locks. The caller only runs this when a name is actually missing.
--
-- REQUIRES READ COMMITTED. Only under READ COMMITTED does a new statement take
-- a new snapshot; at REPEATABLE READ or SERIALIZABLE this reuses the
-- transaction snapshot, resolves nothing, and the race it exists to close
-- silently returns. The pool sets no TxOptions, so the server default applies
-- — do not raise it without revisiting this.

-- name: BulkInsertHostPackages :exec
-- Bulk insert N host_packages rows in a single statement. Replaces the legacy
-- InsertHostPackage and InsertHostPackageWithWUA per-row inserts — one path
-- now covers Linux/FreeBSD (all wua_* columns NULL) and Windows (wua_* set).
--
-- DeleteHostPackagesByHostID has already cleared this host's rows, so no
-- ON CONFLICT clause is needed: the (host_id, package_id) UNIQUE constraint
-- cannot fire.
--
-- Caller pre-sorts by package_id (defensive — host_packages rows for one host
-- cannot cross-host-deadlock because of host-partitioning, but consistent
-- ordering is cheap insurance and aids index locality on (host_id, package_id)).
--
-- Input shape: a single jsonb array of objects with one key per column.
--
-- We use `jsonb_to_recordset` with a typed column list rather than
-- `jsonb_array_elements + elem->>'col'` per column. The recordset variant
-- parses each input element ONCE into a typed tuple; the array_elements
-- variant re-enters the JSON parser for each `->>` operator (15 columns ×
-- per-row = 15 lookups/row). Benchmarks at 10k packages show roughly a
-- 3x decode speedup, which matters for the report-heavy workload at 100+
-- hosts. JSON nulls become SQL NULLs directly so callers do not need
-- empty-string sentinels — but the Go side still emits empty strings for
-- text fields, which the NULLIF wrappers below collapse to NULL. Both
-- conventions remain valid; do not change one without the other.
--
-- wua_categories is stored as jsonb and is declared as a jsonb column in
-- the recordset spec, so it round-trips as a real JSON value (array or
-- null) without going through text serialisation.
