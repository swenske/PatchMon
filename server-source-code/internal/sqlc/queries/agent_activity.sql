-- Agent Activity feed. Returns the merged time-ordered stream of agent comm
-- rows for a given host: inbound reports (update_history) AND outbound jobs
-- (job_history). The two source tables have different shapes; this query
-- normalises them to one column set and discriminates via the `kind` column
-- ('report' or 'job'). Caller passes the host_id, optional direction / type /
-- status filters, optional search string (ILIKE on error_message and job
-- output), optional time-range / limit / offset for pagination.
--
-- CountAgentActivity returns the filtered total separately so stale/deep-linked
-- pages beyond the end can still report the real total.
--
-- The since_ts arg uses sqlc.narg (nullable) on both branches; pgx encodes
-- pgtype.Timestamp{Valid:false} as SQL NULL, which the IS NULL guard catches.

-- name: DeleteOldUpdateHistoryBatch :execrows
-- Retention sweep target, deliberately batched. Steady state deletes a day's
-- worth of rows, but the FIRST sweep after upgrading an existing install has
-- to clear the entire pre-2.0.3 update_history backlog, which was never pruned
-- before — millions of rows on a multi-year install. An unbounded single-
-- statement DELETE would hold one transaction (and its locks / WAL / dead
-- tuples) open for the whole thing. The worker calls this in a loop until it
-- returns 0, so each transaction stays small and interruptible.
--
-- Returns the number of rows deleted so the worker can both log the volume and
-- decide whether to keep looping.
